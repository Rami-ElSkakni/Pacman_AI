# Pacman_AI

This project was inspired by my AI course that I took in University.

The Pac-man in this project is able to find all of the 'dots' that are required to be eaten in order to finish the game. 

The Pac-man finds the dot using various Searching Techniques like: Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Iterative Deepeing, and A*.
We concluded that A* is the best searching technique since it is the only informed search and took the Pac-man the least amount of time.
